=====TO CREATE C2 SELENIUM TESTS IN PYTHON=====

1. Use selenium IDE in firefox to create the test framework
2. In the selenium IDE click file->export test case as-> Python2/unittest/WebDriver
3. Choose a name and directory for your file. (Should be named appropriately and in a fitting folder. If a fitting folder doesnt exist, create a new one!!)
4. Open cmd
5. cd to root testing directory (The one this readme is in)
6. "python format_selenium_test.py 'path_to_test_file/test_file_name.py'"

Your formatted test case is now complete


=====TO CREATE C2 SELENIUM TEST SUITES IN PYTHON=====

1. Have a set of C2 tests you would wish to make a suite out of in a single folder.
2. Open cmd
3. cd to root testing directory (The one this readme is in)
4. "python format_test_suite.py 'test_directory' 'NameOfNewSuite'"

Your formatted test suite is now created inside "test_directory" named "NameOfTestSuite.py"


=====TO RUN A C2 TEST SUITE=====

1. Open cmd
