Update existing SiteGates to 2.2.

======= IMPORTANT =====================================================================================================
We must avoid sending unnecessary notifications to customers.
If we take the SiteGate offline, this will created offline alarms so disable notifications for the SiteGate in SitePortal.

If we rebuild the SiteGate in SitePortal, this will raise notification for all past alarms so it is important to disable notifications for the folder in which the SiteGate will be built.
=======================================================================================================================

SSH to the SiteGate as c2-maintenance

Disable scanning:
mysql -u root -p cswapi_unified -e "UPDATE css_general_config SET var1 = 0 WHERE setting_name = 'enable_scan'"

Wait for scanning to end. This might take a while.
Run this to see if anything is still scanning.

ps -ef | grep "networking/scanners"

When scanning has ended.

cd ~
mkdir upgrade22

/Check which version fo cswapi we have
cd /var/www/cswapi_unified
svn info

Note the end of the URL line on the svn info response.  If it is already cswapi-sitegate-7.2-RC4-ENC then we don't need to copy the cswapi tarball or upgrade cswapi.

We have three tarballs on Frylock

/home/ross/sitegate-22/sitegate-2.2.0.0-RELEASE-ENCODED.tar.gz
/home/ross/sitegate-22/cswapi-sitegate-7.2-RC4-ENC.tar.gz
/home/ross/sitegate-22/listener.tar.gz

The files need to be copied to the SiteGate in the upgrade22 directory we created above. For some (Forza) this can be a direct scp from Frylock. For the VZW SiteGates, they'll need to be copied via thumbdrive or whatever to a VZW terminal. WinSCP can then be used from there to copy to the SiteGate. If the SiteGate is on IPv6 then the files need to be copied to an IPv6 capable server and then scp to the SiteGate.

General scp command:
scp /path-to-tarballs/*.gz c2-maintenance@x.x.x.x:/home/c2-maintenance/upgrade22
or just the SiteGate one
scp /path-to-tarballs/sitegate*.gz c2-maintenance@x.x.x.x:/home/c2-maintenance/upgrade22

x.x.x.x is the address of the SiteGate.

To upgrade Unified on the SiteGate.
cd ~/upgrade22

sudo service apache2 stop

cd ~/sites
mv unified unified-save
tar xzpf ~/upgrade22/sitegate-2.2.0.0-RELEASE-ENCODED.tar.gz
mv sitegate-2.2.0.0-RELEASE-ENCODED/ unified

If cswapi is not already cswapi-sitegate-7.2-RC4-ENC 

cd /var/www

sudo tar xzpf ~/upgrade22/cswapi-sitegate-7.2-RC4-ENC.tar.gz
sudo mv cswapi-sitegate-7.2-RC4-ENC/ cswapi_unified
